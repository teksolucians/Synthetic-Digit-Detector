Feature vector method actually extracts approximately 7 features from the digits, and adds them to one of ten classifiers.  
0, 6 and 9 have some difficulty differentiating amongst each other. Apart from that, all the other numbers are identified accurately.


The initial 100% accuracy identifier works with full accuracy because each one of the 10 digits features was hard coded into its training, pixel for pixel.
